I [came across](https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1154532351235547138) the list of registrants for the 2019 Marblehead Junior Race Week (MJRW) in the local paper, and was kind of appalled by the lack of data cleaning. Indignant outrage without action is cheap, so I thought I'd give it a go myself.

After a few attempts using [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/index.html), I discovered that the data is, indeed, in a super nasty format (aren't `iframes` fun, kids?), and had to go to copy-pasta-ing. But, aside from that (as well the removal of annoying `r emo::ji("us")` flags, and addition of a `Class` variable), the data is still pretty gross. In fact, I'm keeping the window with the [results online](https://www.regattatoolbox.com/results?eventID=8tDOrn7dbe) open as I go to help me parse the madness.

## Packages

```{r libs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```


## Import and inspect

Because each class (420 Champ, 420 Green, Laser, Opti Champ, and Opti Green) has its own structure (i.e. the column headers are not the same), I'll have to deal with them one by one. However, I'll try to use strategies that are generalizable to the other datasets.

```{r}
mjrw_2019_420_champ <- read_csv(here::here("data", "raw", "mjrw_2019_420_champ.csv"), 
    col_types = cols(Position = col_integer()))

mjrw_2019_420_champ
```

So, WTF is going on here? Let's look at [the source](https://www.regattatoolbox.com/results?eventID=8tDOrn7dbe) and see:

![420 Champ results](https://i.imgur.com/2xzehTg.png)

The first difference you probably see is that we've got an abundance of `NA`s, while the original table does not (mainly because there's a bunch of annoying _merged cell_ stuff going on behind the scenes). Each boat (identified by `Sail Number`) has multiple `Sailor(s)`, and the data seems to get oddly divvied up between the two: the `Position` value shows up with the first sailor's name, while the `Sail Number` is down in the row below with the latter. There's also the matter of the decidedly _untidy_ `Boat Name/Club` variable, which contains more than one piece of information.

I'm going to subset the data frame by `Sailor(s)` for illustration purposes, below.[^1]

```{r}
select_sailors <- c("Brooks Reed", "Trent Hesselman", "Ian McCaffrey", "Katy Benagh")

mjrw_2019_420_champ %>%
  filter(`Sailor(s)` %in% select_sailors)
```


### Data modelling

Now's a good moment to pause and think about how we want our data to look in the end -- for now, we'll ignore the actual results section. We _could_ turn `Sailor(s)` into a list column, but I'd rather give each sailor their own row. We also need to separate boat and club names into their own columns, e.g. `Boat Name` and `Club`.

So, I'm hoping for the data to look something like this, in the end:

![420 Champ -- clean-data vision](https://i.imgur.com/K7tPzqR.png)

__How do we get from here to there?__

The pair that came in first didn't have their own boat, which can make things look misleadingly simple:

![420 Champ - Position 1](https://i.imgur.com/NpbzX8L.gif)

For the pair that came in fourth, you wouldn't be able to use this same strategy until _after_ `Boat Name/Club` has been separated into two columns:

![420 Champ data unseparated](https://i.imgur.com/vRSBFcA.png)

Once you've separated `Boat Name` and `Club`, you could fill up and down, like so:

![420 Champ - Position 4](https://i.imgur.com/isae1Zv.gif)

But, how do I tell a computer about this? The only reason I know to put "Kiss My Transform" as `Boat Name` is because it would be a super weird name for a yacht club.

This also means that the "directions" for filling the data depend on whether or not there is a boat name or not:

## Putting the plan into action

Because the order of the rows is important, I'm going to add a `rowid` variable with [`tibble::rowid_to_column()`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/rownames.html). I like this because it automatically puts `rowid` as the first column.

The [`tidyr::fill()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/fill.html) function is handy for, well, filling in data. There were two columns in the mockups above that filled in the same direction regardless of whether or not there was a boat name: `Position`, and `Sail Number`. The `Points` and other scoring columns (not shown in the data model) work the same way as `Position` -- i.e. should fill _down_, regardless of whether `Boat Name/Club` is a boat name or a club name.

I'll reference "the rest of those columns" by creating a collection of the variables we looked at. I'll use tidyselect to grab "the first column through `Boat Name/Club`", and then get the column names using `colnames()`. 

```{r}
mjrw_2019_420_champ %>%
  select(1:`Boat Name/Club`) %>%
  colnames() -> specialcols

specialcols
```

<!-- I'm only going to use it on the `Position` and various results columns for now, since other missing values can help us sort through whether or not the `Boat Name/Club` is, well, a boat name or the name of a club. -->

In `tidyr::fill()`, the default for the `.direction` argument is `"down"`. So I _must_ specify that the fill `.direction` for `Sail Number` should be `"up"`, but I'll provide an argument to `.direction` in all cases for clarity. 

```{r}
mjrw_420_champ <- mjrw_2019_420_champ %>%
  rowid_to_column() %>%
  fill(`Sail Number`, .direction = "up") %>%
  fill(Position, .direction = "down") %>%
  fill(-one_of(specialcols), .direction = "down") # fill down the rest


mjrw_420_champ %>%
  filter(`Sailor(s)` %in% select_sailors)
```

To figure out this pesky boat-name business, I also want to add a variable that counts up the number of if this is the first or second observation per boat (we can use `Sail Number` or `Position` as a proxy for this). I'm filtering to `select_sailors` to make it a bit easier to see how it relates to the data model.

```{r}
mjrw_420_champ %>%
  dplyr::group_by(`Sail Number`) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(sailor_count = dplyr::row_number()) %>%
  filter(`Sailor(s)` %in% select_sailors)
```

Now we can find the sailors who have their own boats by looking for second sailors (`sailor_count == 2`) for whom `Boat Name/Club` is _not_ `NA`. When that's the case, the value of `Boat Name/Club` for the _first_ sailor is the name of a boat.

![Non-`NA` values boat name or club](https://i.imgur.com/GQvVaG1.png)

I'm creating two groups of "second sailors" (`sailor_count == 2`): those with boats, and those without (i.e. those for whom `Boat Name/Club` is `NA`). For all second sailors with boats, the value for `Boat Names/Club` will be the name of a club. So, we'll rename the variable `Club`. For those _without_ boats it is be definition `NA`, so we'll drop the column.[^2]

```{r}
mjrw_420_champ <- mjrw_420_champ %>%
  dplyr::group_by(`Sail Number`) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(sailor_count = dplyr::row_number()) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
have_boats <- mjrw_420_champ %>%
  filter(sailor_count == 2) %>%
  drop_na(`Boat Name/Club`)

no_boats <- mjrw_420_champ %>%
  filter(sailor_count == 2) %>%
  anti_join(have_boats) %>% # get the ones we didn't drop
  select(-`Boat Name/Club`) # get rid of this column bc all NA

have_boats_clubs <- mjrw_420_champ %>%
  filter(sailor_count == 2) %>%
  drop_na(`Boat Name/Club`) %>%
  rename(Club = `Boat Name/Club`)

have_boats_clubs
```

The names of the home club for groups without a boat is with their _first_ sailor (`sailor_count == 1`):

```{r}
no_boats_clubs <- mjrw_420_champ %>%
  filter(Position %in% no_boats$Position,
         sailor_count == 1) %>%
  rename(Club = `Boat Name/Club`)

no_boats_clubs
```


```{r include=FALSE}
sails_clubs <- have_boats_clubs %>%
  bind_rows(no_boats_clubs) %>%
  select(Position, `Sail Number`, Club) %>%
  arrange(Position)
```

OK, so we know which positions have boats. Let's get the boat names. Again, we'll rename our variable to fit the contents.

```{r}
sails_names <- mjrw_420_champ %>%
  filter(Position %in% have_boats$Position,
         sailor_count == 1) %>%
  rename(`Boat Name` = `Boat Name/Club`) %>%
  select(Position, `Sail Number`, `Boat Name`)

sails_names
```

We can now isolate this in a lookup table of sorts by combining our `Club` and `Boat Name` data for each group. Since _most_ groups do not have a boat name, most of the `Boat Name` observations will be `NA`.

```{r}
info_by_sails <- sails_clubs %>%
  left_join(sails_names)

info_by_sails
```

### Put our boats and sailors back together...

Umm, let's see. If all went according to plan, we should be able to join the `Boat Name` and `Club` to our modified data by `Position` and `Sail Number`. We can then get rid of pesky `Boat Name/Club`, and we'll rename `Sailor(s)` to singular.

```{r}
clean_mjrw_420_champ <- mjrw_420_champ %>%
  left_join(info_by_sails) %>%
  select(-`Boat Name/Club`) %>%
  rename(Sailor = `Sailor(s)`) %>%
  select(1:Sailor, `Boat Name`, Club, everything())

clean_mjrw_420_champ
```

```{r}
write_csv(clean_mjrw_420_champ, here::here("data", "clean", "420_champ.csv"))
```

## Other datasets?

Oh yeah, those... It's probably time to consider some function writing and refactoring. Here's the copy pasta involved with just "redoing" everything from above, and it is not pretty.

```{r}
mjrw_2019_420_green <- read_csv(here::here("data", "raw", "mjrw_2019_420_green.csv"), 
                                col_types = cols(Position = col_integer()))

mjrw_2019_420_green %>%
  select(1:`Boat Name/Club`) %>%
  colnames() -> specialcols
```

```{r}
mjrw_420_green <- mjrw_2019_420_green %>%
  rowid_to_column() %>%
  fill(`Sail Number`, .direction = "up") %>%
  fill(Position, .direction = "down") %>%
  fill(-one_of(specialcols), .direction = "down") %>%
  dplyr::group_by(`Sail Number`) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(sailor_count = dplyr::row_number()) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
have_boats <- mjrw_420_green %>%
  filter(sailor_count == 2) %>%
  drop_na(`Boat Name/Club`)

no_boats <- mjrw_420_green %>%
  filter(sailor_count == 2) %>%
  anti_join(have_boats) %>% # get the ones we didn't drop
  select(-`Boat Name/Club`) # get rid of this column bc all NA

have_boats_clubs <- mjrw_420_green %>%
  filter(sailor_count == 2) %>%
  drop_na(`Boat Name/Club`) %>%
  rename(Club = `Boat Name/Club`)

no_boats_clubs <- mjrw_420_green %>%
  filter(Position %in% no_boats$Position,
         sailor_count == 1) %>%
  rename(Club = `Boat Name/Club`)

```

```{r}
sails_clubs <- have_boats_clubs %>%
  bind_rows(no_boats_clubs) %>%
  select(Position, `Sail Number`, Club) %>%
  arrange(Position)

sails_names <- mjrw_420_green %>%
  filter(Position %in% have_boats$Position,
         sailor_count == 1) %>%
  rename(`Boat Name` = `Boat Name/Club`) %>%
  select(Position, `Sail Number`, `Boat Name`)

info_by_sails <- sails_clubs %>%
  left_join(sails_names)
```

```{r}
clean_mjrw_420_green <- mjrw_420_green %>%
  left_join(info_by_sails) %>%
  select(-`Boat Name/Club`) %>%
  rename(Sailor = `Sailor(s)`) %>%
  select(1:Sailor, `Boat Name`, Club, everything())
```


```{r}
write_csv(clean_mjrw_420_green, here::here("data", "clean", "420_green.csv"))
```

[^1]: Yes, it turns out there _are_ actually two records that have `NA` for `Sailor(s)`, which is weird, bc I'm pretty sure this was a two-handed race.
[^2]: Note, it is not the name of their club. That data is with the first sailor in cases where there is no boat name.
